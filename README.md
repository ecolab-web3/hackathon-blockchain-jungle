## About The Project

This repository contains a smart contract prototype that tokenizes **Recycling Credits** as **Real World Assets (RWA)** on the blockchain, bringing transparency, auditability, and liquidity to the circular economy.

This project has been successfully migrated to a professional **Hardhat environment**, rigorously tested with **100% code coverage**, deployed, and verified on the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet**.

## Live Interaction & dApps

Please make sure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet** to interact with the project components.

### dApp Prototypes

*   **Recyclers Portal (Proof Generation):** This tool is for cooperatives and originators to generate the necessary data and proof hash for certification.
    *   **[➡️ Access the Recyclers Portal (english version)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/recyclers-en.html)**
    *   **[➡️ Acesse o Portal dos Recicladores (versão em português)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/recyclers-pt_br.html)**

*   **Admin Panel (Credit Minting & Role Management):** This secure panel is for certifiers and admins to mint credits and manage roles.
    *   **[➡️ Access the Admin Panel (english version, for authorized users only)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/admin-en.html)**
    *   **[➡️ Acesse o Painel do Administrador (versão em português, somente para usuários autorizados)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/admin-pt_br.html)**

### Contract Details

*   **Network:** `Avalanche Fuji Testnet`
*   **Contract Address:** [`0xe18e887380bD90BCEa276747DaD314DfB06c1f4f`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xe18e887380bD90BCEa276747DaD314DfB06c1f4f)
*   **Verification:** The source code is verified. You can read and interact with it directly on **[Snowtrace's "Write Contract" Tab](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xe18e887380bD90BCEa276747DaD314DfB06c1f4f#writeContract)**.

## Development Environment & Testing

This project was migrated from Remix IDE to a professional Hardhat environment to ensure quality and reproducibility.

*   **Framework:** Hardhat
*   **Solidity Version:** `0.8.20`
*   **Testing:** A comprehensive test suite was developed using `ethers.js` and `Chai`. The suite consists of **16 passing tests** covering all contract functions and logic paths.

### Test Coverage

The project achieved **100% test coverage** across all metrics, ensuring every line and logical branch of the contract was verified.

## Overview

The core idea is to transform a certified recycling credit into an **ERC721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**. Each NFT represents a specific amount of post-consumer material that has been verifiably recycled, turning this right into a liquid, transferable, and transparent digital asset.

### Key Concepts Implemented

*   **Role-Based Access Control**: The contract uses `AccessControl` with a `CERTIFIER_ROLE` that is exclusively authorized to mint new credit NFTs.
*   **Credit Minting**: A user with the `CERTIFIER_ROLE` can mint new NFTs using data generated by the Recycler's Portal.
*   **Credit Retirement**: The NFT owner can "retire" their credit via the `retire` function, creating an immutable public record of its use.
*   **Transferability**: As a standard ERC721 token, the credit can be freely traded on any NFT marketplace until it is retired.
*   **Security and Transparency**: The contract uses standard OpenZeppelin libraries and its code is publicly verified.

## Next Steps

This prototype is a functional foundation. For a production-ready project, the next steps focus on usability, data integrity, and security.

### 1. Implement an Upgradable Contract using the Proxy Pattern

To allow for future feature additions or bug fixes without forcing users to migrate to a new contract, the next logical step is to implement an upgradable contract using OpenZeppelin's Upgrades Contracts.

### 2. Build a Full dApp Ecosystem: Marketplace and Portals

A production version requires dedicated interfaces for each user type, building upon the existing prototypes:
*   **Marketplace Creation:** A frontend (e.g., using React, Vue) that serves as a marketplace where companies can browse available credits and purchase them directly.
*   **Enhance Admin & Certifier Panel:** Transform the prototype panel into a comprehensive dashboard for managing roles and minting credits.
*   **Enhance Recycler's Portal:** Improve the prototype by adding features like a submission history and a direct communication channel to the certifiers.

### 3. Develop a Secure Oracle for Proof Verification

To automate and decentralize the proof verification process, an oracle could be developed to read government-issued electronic invoices and submit their cryptographic hash (`proofHash`) to the `certifyAndMint` function.

### 4. Undergo a Professional Security Audit

Before any mainnet deployment, a full audit by a reputable third-party security firm is essential to ensure the safety of the system.
