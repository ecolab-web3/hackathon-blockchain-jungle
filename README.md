This repository contains a smart contract prototype that tokenizes **Recycling Credits** as **Real World Assets (RWA)** on the blockchain, bringing transparency, auditability, and liquidity to the circular economy.

This project has been successfully deployed and verified on the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet** and includes several DApp prototypes to demonstrate the workflow.

## Live Interaction & DApps

Please make sure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the **Avalanche Fuji Testnet** to interact with the project components.

### DApp Prototypes

*   **Recycler's Portal (Proof Generation):** This tool is for cooperatives and originators to generate the necessary data and proof hash for certification.
    *   **[➡️ Access the Recycler's Portal (english version)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/recyclers-en.html)**
    *   **[➡️ Acesse o Portal do Reciclador (versão em português)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/recyclers-pt_br.html)**

*   **Admin Panel (Credit Minting & Role Management):** This secure panel is for certifiers and admins to mint credits and manage roles.
    *   **[➡️ Access the Admin Panel (english version, for authorized users only)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/admin-en.html)**
    *   **[➡️ Acesse o Painel do Administrador (versão em português, somente para usuários autorizados)](https://ecolab-web3.github.io/recyclingcredits-rwa-solidity/admin-pt_br.html)**

### Contract Details

*   **Network:** `Avalanche Fuji Testnet`
*   **Contract Address:** [`0xe18e887380bD90BCEa276747DaD314DfB06c1f4f`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xe18e887380bD90BCEa276747DaD314DfB06c1f4f)
*   **Verification:** The source code is verified. You can read and interact with it directly on **[Snowtrace's "Write Contract" Tab](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xe18e887380bD90BCEa276747DaD314DfB06c1f4f#writeContract)**.

## Overview

The core idea is to transform a certified recycling credit into an **ERC721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**. Each NFT represents a specific amount of post-consumer material that has been verifiably recycled, turning this right into a liquid, transferable, and transparent digital asset.

### Key Concepts Implemented

*   **Role-Based Access Control**: The contract uses `AccessControl` with a `CERTIFIER_ROLE` that is exclusively authorized to mint new credit NFTs.
*   **Credit Minting**: A user with the `CERTIFIER_ROLE` can mint new NFTs using data generated by the Recycler's Portal.
*   **Credit Retirement**: The NFT owner can "retire" their credit via the `retire` function, creating an immutable public record of its use.
*   **Transferability**: As a standard ERC721 token, the credit can be freely traded on any NFT marketplace until it is retired.
*   **Security and Transparency**: The contract uses standard OpenZeppelin libraries and its code is publicly verified.

## Next Steps

This prototype is a functional foundation. For a production-ready project, the next steps focus on usability, data integrity, and security.

### 1. Implement an Upgradable Contract using the Proxy Pattern

To allow for future feature additions or bug fixes without forcing users to migrate to a new contract, the next logical step is to implement an upgradable contract using OpenZeppelin's Upgrades Contracts. This would enable future evolution, such as adding multiple trusted certifiers or integrating more complex financial mechanisms.

### 2. Build a Full DApp Ecosystem: Marketplace and Portals

A production version requires dedicated interfaces for each user type, building upon the existing prototypes:
*   **Marketplace Creation:** A frontend (e.g., using React, Vue) that serves as a marketplace where companies can browse available credits, filter by material/location, and purchase them directly. It would also include a dashboard for companies to manage their portfolio of credits and call the `retire` function.
*   **Enhance Admin & Certifier Panel:** Transform the prototype panel into a comprehensive dashboard for managing roles and minting credits, possibly with a database to view pending certification requests from the Recycler's Portal.
*   **Enhance Recycler's Portal:** Improve the prototype by adding features like a submission history and a direct communication channel (or database entry) to the certifiers, streamlining the workflow.

### 3. Develop a Secure Oracle for Proof Verification

To automate and decentralize the proof verification process, an oracle can be developed.
*   **What it is:** An oracle is a service that securely fetches off-chain data and submits it to the smart contract.
*   **How it works:** In this context, it could read government-issued electronic invoices, validate them, and submit their cryptographic hash (`proofHash`) to the `certifyAndMint` function. This reduces manual work, minimizes human error, and further increases trust in the system's data integrity.

### 4. Undergo a Professional Security Audit

Before deploying to a mainnet and handling real value, a full audit by a reputable third-party security firm is essential. This process rigorously checks the smart contract code for vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflows, access control issues, and other common attack vectors, ensuring the safety of the system.
